# More Building Blocks

More Building Blocks is a mod that aims to add blocks that could be seen as 'missing,' as well as much, much more.

The wiki is more up-to-date than this readme will ever be, so for information such as our Version History/changelogs, block set/material lists, refer to it instead.
